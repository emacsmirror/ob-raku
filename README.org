#+title: Readme

Bindings for [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org-babel]] support for [[https://raku.org/][Raku]] (n√©e Perl6).

** Usage
Same as other org-babble things. In most cases you'll want to be sure to include =:results output= in your =+begin_src= line.

#+begin_src org-mode

,#+begin_src raku :results output
say("boy howdy!");
,#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: boy howdy!


,#+begin_src raku
say("boy howdy!");
,#+end_src

,#+RESULTS:
: Bool::True


#+end_src




Not in Melpa... yet. I'll get there soon.
